Resolved an issue where event checkboxes in the Game Settings menu did not retain their state after saving, causing all events to revert to being checked when reopening the menu. Now, the selected events are properly saved and loaded as expected.

Added pitch support to ambience and music in the audio settings menu. I also converted volumes and pitches to percentages for ambiences and music as well.
Reversed the probability logic for event chances in auto and manual baking. Previously, setting the event chance to 0% resulted in events triggering every time, behaving as though it were set to 100%. Now, a 0% chance will correctly prevent events from triggering, while a 100% chance will trigger events consistently.
Added the ability to adjust the probability chanse of triggering random events when baking auto or manule cookies.
